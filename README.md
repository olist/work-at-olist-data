Discover why customers are happy or unhappy or tell us how to improve delivery performance. You name it... there is a ton of thins that you might do with the data. Just show us that you are a Pandas Ninja, a Jedi Master of scikit-learn and that you are able to build fantastic visualizations. Statistics and SQL are also important skills.

### Data Engineer
